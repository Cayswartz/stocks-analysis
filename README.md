### Advantages & Disadvantages
The benefits of refactoring VBA is that it helps simplify the code making it easier to understand, more mainatabilty and easier to scale as you continue to work with it. Additionally, refactoring requires that you go back through your code closer ensuring that there are no bugs and potential issues that could cause larger issues in the future.

The primary disadvantages of refactoring code is that at times it can be time consuming. At times it can be frustrating because you are diving into code that is already written and working properly to clean it up but at times through this process you can end up breaking it and then having to find the correct way to repair it and create the same fuctionality again. 

As a whole, refactoring can do create things for your code but make sure to keep in mind the time that it could take to rework it.
