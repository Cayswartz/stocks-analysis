### Advantages & Disadvantages
I ran into some issues with developing the COUNTIFS statements. While the statements themselves are fairly straight forward I found myself making mistakes like only doing larger and smaller statements rather than larger or equal to. I overcame this by slowing down and paying close attention to each piece of the equation that I wrote. Once I was able to slow down instead of rushing through all the equations I needed to write I was able to start producing the correct numbers in the table. 


### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
1. May saw the strongest performance in terms of successfully launched campaigns
2. October saw a large spike in failed campaigns with 50 failed campaigns.
